# Sorting Visualizer

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with JavaScript array managment, along with incorporating previous Python and C coding experiences by challenging myself to figure out how to write a Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort functions. This project was completed by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a React framework.

## What did I learn?

Although I already have prior experience with HTML and CSS, the use of a .jsx extension was new to me. It's just like using <script> in an HTML file, but vice versa in this case. This project has mostly helped me better understand array manipulation in JavaScript, just like Python, C, and C++.
