# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a React web application that generates a new array and allows the user to see the sortings of these arrays via Merge, Quick, Heap, and Bubble Sort. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with JavaScript array managment, along with incorporating previous Python and C coding experiences by challenging myself to figure out how to write a Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort functions. This project was completed by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a React framework.

## What did I learn?

Although I already have prior experience with HTML and CSS, the use of a .jsx extension was new to me. It's just like using <script> in an HTML file, but vice versa in this case. This project has mostly helped me better understand array manipulation in JavaScript, just like Python, C, and C++. I have taken insightful information from YouTube videos that helped me visualize the sorting methods. The links are provided below:
